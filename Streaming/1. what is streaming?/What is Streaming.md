### 🔹 What is **streaming** in LangChain?

In **LangChain**, *streaming* refers to the ability to receive **partial outputs from a language model (LLM) as they are being generated**, instead of waiting for the full response.

Normally, when you call an LLM, you only get the **final completed text** once the model finishes. With streaming, you can **see tokens (words or characters) as they are generated in real-time** — similar to how you see text appear gradually when chatting with ChatGPT.

### 🔹 Why is this useful?

* **Faster user feedback** → Users don’t have to wait for the full answer before seeing something.
* **Interactive experiences** → You can update a UI (like a chat window) in real time.
* **Fine-grained control** → Developers can intercept and act on tokens (e.g., for live translation, highlighting keywords, or detecting stop conditions early).

### 🔹 How it works in LangChain

LangChain provides a **callback system**. When streaming is enabled:

* The LLM generates tokens.
* Each token (or chunk of text) is passed to a callback function.
* You can decide what to do with it — e.g., print it to the console, display it in a web app, or send it over a websocket.

The **three main categories of data you can stream in LangGraph** are:

1. **Workflow progress** → get state updates after each graph node is executed.
2. **LLM tokens** → stream language model tokens as they’re generated.
3. **Custom updates** → emit user-defined signals (e.g., “Fetched 10/100 records”). ✅
